== Description ==

This is an example of how to integrate a complex jQuery component with pyjs.

Here we integrate Select2 to implement a tagging component.
Not all functionality of Select2 is implemented. Only:

- set / get values
- receive change notifications

== Issues ==

pyjd is not supported (doesn't do javascript)

The CSS is not right
